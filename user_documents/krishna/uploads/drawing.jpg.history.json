See README file for more information.\"\n\nThis means that the program is unable to find the Tesseract software, which is required to extract text from images. The solution would be to:\n\n1. Install Tesseract on the system (if it's not already installed).\n2. Make sure Tesseract is added to the system's PATH environment variable so that the program can find it.\n\nIn other words, the prompt is asking me to tell them what this error message says, and my response is: \"Tesseract software is not installed or not in your PATH, check README file for installation instructions.\""
