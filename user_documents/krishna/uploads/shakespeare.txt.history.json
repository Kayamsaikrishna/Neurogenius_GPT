        "response": "This document appears to be a poetic narrative, specifically an excerpt from John Donne's poem \"The Ecstasy\" (also known as \"The Triple Fool\") or possibly his poem \"The Sun Rising\". However, the most likely candidate for this text is actually a portion of John Donne's poem \"A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning\", but more specifically, it seems to be an excerpt from another poem by John Donne, namely \"The Flea\" and then again \"The Sun Rising\", or rather, it might also be part of his poem \"A Nocturnal Upon St. Lucy's Day, Being the Shortest Day\".\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I believe this text is actually a segment from John Donne's poem \"Elegy XIX: To His Mistress Going to Bed\" and then again another poem by him.\n\nBut most specifically, it seems that this document is an excerpt from his poem \"Valediction Forbidding Mourning\".\n\nHowever, more accurately, the final part of the text appears to be a segment from John Donne's poem \"The Sun Rising\", which is a metaphysical poem written in 1630."
