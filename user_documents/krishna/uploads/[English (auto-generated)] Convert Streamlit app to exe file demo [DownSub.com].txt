so hi everyone today we will be walking

through a very interesting demonstration

on how you can convert streamlet

application or any other application in

your system into aexe file that is an

executable file which can act like a

software so basically this can be very

helpful when you wish to share your

codes we should share your

demonstrations your PS to non Tech guys

who don't have python installed in your

system other libraries don't are not

installed in their system and is good

for res sharing purposes so today in

this particular demonstration we will

learn how this can be done so first of

all you should be creating a virtual

environment in your desktop basically

just navigate to the point where you

wish to create this virtual environment

and then first of all install virtual n

so this is a package that will help you

very straightforwardly to create a

virtual environment now I already have a

virtual environment in my system as well

as I have this Library also so I'm not

installing this how to create a virtual

environment using virtual

n this is the command very simple just

call virtual n and name of your virtual

environment so in this case I'm naming

it as demo I won't be creating it right

now because it will take some time

rather I will use one of my existing

virtual environments that I've already

created for this demonstration that is

test so how to activate a virtual

environment which has been created using

virtual n Library you just need to use

this particular command dots forwards uh

backwards slash name of the virtual

environment that you have given for me

this is it is test then backward SL

scripts backward SL

activate and then just do an enter now

here you can see that test has been

activated as you can see now there are

couple of things that you need to

consider first of all in this virtual

environment you need to P install CX

freeze we install CX

freeze and streamlit that application

and other libraries also that you are

using so in the demonstration that I

will be building it would be a very very

basic streamer application that is the

hello world but if you are having

complicated application I would rather

suggest you to install all the required

libraries now once you have installed

everything just do a pip freeze to check

out whether all the requirements are

available or not especially CX freeze

and

streamlit now for streamlit a very

interesting case is that you need to use

a very specific version to run this

particular demo that is streamlit

13.0 here you can see that stream L is

present do remember to use this version

else you would be facing a lot of issues

as I fa a number of issues now here is

CSP as you can see so these are the two

major Library libraries that I would be

using in my codes now what I will be

doing I will be showing you my streamlit

code and eventually a run file that I

have created for it that will get that

will initiate the streamlet application

from

python so here you can see that I have

created two applications in the folder

demo to for now I will just open wanted

to show you the

content this is a little tricky process

on creating a because at times you would

be able to create the AE but the XE

would fail on launching because it took

me nearly a week to complete this demo

because there are version issues the

demonstrations the tutorials present on

the internet were not right so I think I

need to figure out lot lot of things but

now it is working for me so here you can

see that the streamlet code very

Baseline this title and WR uh any other

labrary that you would be using I would

suggest you to install it in the virtual

environment now this is the basic

application where our main file exist

that is a app.py now you need to create

one more file that is setup.py and here

you can see that this content is very

important the most important segment in

this file is this particular section

where you can see that I'm launching the

streamlit app streamlit run app.py using

this setup file this is very very

important this content and also do

remember that in this particular file

import all the libraries that you are

using app.py for a better wrapping off

of discrepancies so I uh I just was

facing many issues when I was using

different libraries in app.py but were

not mentioning them in setup.py then

that was creating some issues in

launching the application so I would

suggest if you're using some Library say

pyit learn or pandas do mention it in

setup.py as well so that will help you

to uh create your EXE more comfortably

else you will be facing many issues now

this is the copy paste code that you

need to do just copy paste everything as

it is and name change the name of the

file that you have used so here it is

app.py as you know now once you have

created these two files what you need to

do you need to do nothing just move to

that particular folder CD demo

2 and call CX

freeze hyphen

script and setup. so setup.py is the

file which is launching the main stream

L tab do remember that and do an

enter now this will create some this

will take some time as you can see that

uh the execution has started it is now

starting off with building your exe file

this will take some time by the time

I've already created the demon uh in

other file so we will check

that now here you can see that once the

execution is successful

uh in the logs you would be able to

check here this will take some minutes

our new folder called as build will

appear now in this build you need to

again navigate to Windows and then

you'll see a number of files here where

one of the files is setup.exe which is

our actual exe file that we are looking

for now before launching this do

remember that you need to copy both the

files the app and the setup.py

in the same folder as the exe as else

you will face some issues so hence here

you can see that I've already copy

pasted app.py and setup.py also any

other file that you're using like for

example you might be reading some CSV so

do copy that in this folder and then

just launch setup.exe

this will again open up a terminal

window for you where you will be able to

see that it is launching the streamlit

app on a local host

URL if everything goes right

now here you can see that the streamlet

app has been

launched on local 8501 using aexe file

it is loading and then it will show you

the basic message that we are printing

in a app.py

file yeah here you can see that the app

is executing here you can if you

entering something the logs would be

available here in the setup.exe so this

is how you can create an exe file for

your streamlet app for sharing purposes

couple of things to remember one is to

create a virtual environment second the

version of streamlet is very important

that is

1.13.0 for to follow this particular

tutorial and third is to copy paste the

files that you are using into the exe

file folder the same folder the build

folder that you have seen and this is

how eventually the application would be

created very easy to use also and looks

very fine the catch is the size of this

folder would be huge like about 200 250

MBS and depends upon depending upon the

libraries that you're using the file

would the folder would become even

bigger so do remember that it is just

for sharing your PS don't try to make

build setups as the method is not

optimized because it will be wrapping up

all the libraries so thank you so much

now here you can see see that the

command that we started off is now

showing some logs it is started creating

the exe file for us so logs would look

something like this and the output would

look something like the exe file that

you saw just now thank you
